Bluetooth Farm Robot
In this project, we are intended to make a robot car that reduces the time and effort spend on
crops and fields for farmers. The main tasks of the robot are real time monitoring, and
measuring temperature and humidity of the environment. Itâ€™s controlled by a mobile phone
via Bluetooth. The robot has a micro controller (Arduino) for data processing, a servo motor
to move left and right directions, a humidity and temperature sensor, a Bluetooth module for
transmitting and receiving data, and an IP camera for real time monitoring.

The Bluetooth controlled farm robot has following features:
1) It can be controlled remotely with a mobile app via Bluetooth.
2) It can measure temperature and humidity.
3) Remote observation with IP camera.
4) Long-time use with rechargeable batteries.
5) In the mobile app, a triggering alarm value of the temperature or humidity can be set.
6) With the help of the virtual joystick in the mobile app, controlling the robot is
smoother and easier.
